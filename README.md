# Machine Learning - Classification

This repository is a Machine Learning collection of jupyter notebooks containing classification experiments.

## Notebooks

**Dog or Pig?**

This jupyter notebook contains simple train data of dogs and pigs with three distinct features.
Test data is used to test the model's accuracy score.

**Did they buy?**

This is the first of the notebooks to use external data, as a csv containing the train data is loaded from the ```data``` directory.
This test case implements a model that tries to predict whether a website user bought something from its store.
Predictions are based around the pages the user visited while browsing the website. Such pages are the features.
